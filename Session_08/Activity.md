## 🔍 Activity: What Can K-Means Detect?

The goal of this activity is to **think critically** about how k-means clustering might behave in different situations.

Look at each dataset and ask yourself:
- Do the dots form **clearly separated blobs**, or do they form **shapes or curves**?
- If k-means looks for **centroids** and uses **Euclidean distance**, what kind of clusters would it find?

### 💡 Remember:
- K-means works best when clusters are **spherical and evenly spaced**.
- It **may not work well** if clusters are oddly shaped or overlapping.

## ✅ Task

For each dataset:
1. **Guess**: Do you think k-means would cluster this correctly?
2. **Why do you think that?** (Try to explain what you see)
