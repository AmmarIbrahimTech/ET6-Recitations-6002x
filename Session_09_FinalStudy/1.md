# Final Review Session
## 1. Machine Learning Concepts
### a. Data Overview

The data provided for the following questions includes information about 6 individuals, categorized by their happiness status (Happy/Unhappy). The features we know about each person are:

| Happy/Unhappy | Income (dollars) | Distance from North Pole (miles) | Continents Visited | Age |
|---------------|------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|-----|
| Happy         | 10k              | 4k                               | Europe              | 25  |
| Happy         | 30k              | 10k                              | Europe              | 19  |
| Happy         | 90k              | 5k                               | Europe              | 26  |
| Unhappy       | 100k             | 1k                               | Europe              | 57  |
| Unhappy       | 120k             | 1k                               | Europe              | 60  |
| Unhappy       | 60k              | 6k                               | Europe              | 40  |

###  b. Questions to Answer

1. **Using the Manhattan Distance and looking only at "Income" and "Distance from North Pole", which two people are closest and farthest?**

2. **If we were to cluster the people, the inclusion/exclusion of which feature would never impact the final clusters?**

## d. Manhattan Distance Calculations

Here are the calculations of Manhattan distance between each pair of individuals based on "Income" and "Distance from North Pole":

- **Person 1 vs Person 2:**  
  |10k - 30k| + |4k - 10k| = 20k + 6k = 26k
- **Person 1 vs Person 3:**  
  |10k - 90k| + |4k - 5k| = 80k + 1k = 81k
- **Person 1 vs Person 4:**  
  |10k - 100k| + |4k - 1k| = 90k + 3k = 93k
- **Person 1 vs Person 5:**  
  |10k - 120k| + |4k - 1k| = 110k + 3k = 113k
- **Person 1 vs Person 6:**  
  |10k - 60k| + |4k - 6k| = 50k + 2k = 52k
- - **Person 2 vs Person 3:**  
  |30k - 90k| + |10k - 5k| = 60k + 5k = 65k
- **Person 2 vs Person 4:**  
  |30k - 100k| + |10k - 1k| = 70k + 9k = 79k
- **Person 2 vs Person 5:**  
  |30k - 120k| + |10k - 1k| = 90k + 9k = 99k
- **Person 2 vs Person 6:**  
  |30k - 60k| + |10k - 6k| = 30k + 4k = 34k

- **Person 3 vs Person 4:**  
  |90k - 100k| + |5k - 1k| = 10k + 4k = 14k
- **Person 3 vs Person 5:**  
  |90k - 120k| + |5k - 1k| = 30k + 4k = 34k
- **Person 3 vs Person 6:**  
  |90k - 60k| + |5k - 6k| = 30k + 1k = 31k

- **Person 4 vs Person 5:**  
  |100k - 120k| + |1k - 1k| = 20k + 0k = 20k
- **Person 4 vs Person 6:**  
  |100k - 60k| + |1k - 6k| = 40k + 5k = 45k

- **Person 5 vs Person 6:**  
  |120k - 60k| + |1k - 6k| = 60k + 5k = 65k

## e. Answer to Clustering Question

### Impact of Feature Exclusion:

  In this case, the feature "Continents Visited" would not impact the final clusters. Since all individuals in this dataset have visited only Europe, there's no variation in this feature.
